  ask_sdk_model

The SDK works on model classes rather than native Alexa JSON requests and
responses. These model classes are generated using the Request, Response JSON
schemas from the `developer docs <https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html>`__. The source code for the model classes can be
found `here <https://github.com/alexa-labs/alexa-apis-for-python>`__.
