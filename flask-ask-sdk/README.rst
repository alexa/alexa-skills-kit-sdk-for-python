====================================================
Flask ASK SDK - Extending ASK SDK to work with Flask
====================================================

**flask-ask-sdk** is the extension package, that will let skill developers
use `ASK SDK <https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-python/overview.html>`__
package in their Flask application. It provides an easy way to register and
use `skills as custom webservices <https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/host-a-custom-skill-as-a-web-service.html>`__.

Quick Start
-----------

.. warning::

    These features are currently in beta. You can view the source
    code in the
    `Ask Python Sdk <https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-python>`__
    repo on GitHub. The interface might change when the features are released as
    stable.

If you already have a skill built using the ASK SDK skill builders, then you
only need to do the following, to set this up in your flask app:

.. code-block:: python

    from flask import Flask
    from ask_sdk_core.skill_builder import SkillBuilder
    from flask_ask_sdk.skill_adapter import SkillAdapter

    sb = SkillBuilder()
    # Register all handlers, interceptors etc.
    # For eg : sb.add_request_handler(LaunchRequestHandler())

    app = Flask(__name__)
    skill_response = SkillAdapter(
        skill=sb.create(), skill_id=<YOUR_SKILL_ID>, app=app)

    skill_response.register(app=app, route="/")

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run()

Are you planning to deploy your skill on AWS Lambda? Then, you don't even
need this package. The `ASK SDK` provides a `lambda_handler` that can be
directly used in your lambda console.

More code examples can be found `here <https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-python/sample-skills.html>`__.

Features
--------

- Works as an extension on skills built using ASK SDK. No need to learn
  something new.
- Provides default request signature and request timestamp verification.
  These can be configured on app level by setting / unsetting app
  configuration.
- Provides a way to register multiple skills on your app, at different
  endpoints.

Installation
------------

.. important::

    `cryptography` is a dependency for this package. If you have not
    already installed
    `cryptography <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/>`_, you might need to
    install additional prerequisites as detailed in the
    `cryptography installation guide <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/installation/>`_
    for your operating system.

Assuming that you have Python and ``virtualenv`` installed, you can
install the package and it's dependencies (``ask-sdk-webservice-support``,
``flask``) from PyPi as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ virtualenv venv
    $ . venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install flask-ask-sdk

This package is **not** installed along-side `ask-sdk` standard distribution,
and has to be installed separately if you need support for skill
deployment as webservice, using Flask.


SDK Usage and Getting Started
-----------------------------

Getting started guides, SDK Features, API references, samples etc. can
be found in the `technical documentation <https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-python/overview.html>`_
